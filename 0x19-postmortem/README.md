Issue Summary
Duration: The outage occurred on June 5, 2024, from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM UTC. This 90-minute disruption was particularly impactful as it coincided with peak usage hours in our primary market, resulting in significant user inconvenience and operational challenges.

Impact: The main web application was unavailable, causing 80% of users to experience "503 Service Unavailable" errors. This outage affected nearly 120,000 active users, preventing them from accessing critical services. Our customer support received over 1,500 complaints, and our social media channels saw a spike in negative feedback. This incident not only disrupted user experience but also potentially led to revenue losses estimated at approximately $25,000 due to transaction failures.

Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. A recent update included a typographical error in the server pool definition, which caused all incoming traffic to be routed to a single server instead of being distributed evenly across multiple servers. This single server was quickly overwhelmed, leading to the observed service disruption.

Timeline
2:00 PM: Monitoring alert received indicating a spike in HTTP 503 errors.
2:05 PM: On-call engineer received the alert and began investigating.
2:10 PM: Initial hypothesis suggested a database issue due to recent similar incidents.
2:20 PM: Database team confirmed there were no issues on their end.
2:30 PM: Focus shifted to the application servers after clearing the database as the cause.
2:40 PM: Discovered that all traffic was being routed to a single server.
2:45 PM: Checked the load balancer configuration and identified the typographical error.
2:50 PM: Corrected the configuration and redeployed it.
3:00 PM: Observed normalization of traffic distribution across servers.
3:15 PM: Services began recovering, and user access gradually restored.
3:30 PM: Full service restoration confirmed, and normal operations resumed.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The issue stemmed from a recent update to the load balancer configuration, where a typo in the server pool definition caused all incoming traffic to be routed to a single server. This server, not equipped to handle the entire load, quickly became overwhelmed, resulting in the 503 errors.

Resolution: The misconfiguration was corrected by updating the load balancer configuration file to properly distribute traffic across all available servers. This corrected configuration was thoroughly tested in a staging environment to ensure accuracy and stability. After successful testing, the configuration was applied to the production environment. Additionally, a rollback plan was prepared to quickly revert changes if necessary, ensuring minimal risk of future disruptions.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Configuration Review: Implement a peer-review process for all configuration changes to catch errors before deployment.
Enhanced Monitoring: Improve monitoring to include metrics on traffic distribution across servers, which would allow for quicker detection of similar issues.
Automated Testing: Introduce automated tests for load balancer configurations in staging environments to validate changes before they reach production.
Specific Tasks:

Task 1: Develop and implement a peer-review process for load balancer configuration changes to ensure multiple sets of eyes review critical updates.
Task 2: Enhance monitoring tools to track and alert on traffic distribution anomalies across servers, providing early warnings for load imbalances.
Task 3: Create automated testing scripts to validate load balancer configurations in a controlled staging environment before deployment to production.
Task 4: Conduct training sessions for the engineering team on configuration management best practices, emphasizing the importance of accuracy and peer reviews.
